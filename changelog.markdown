# 8.0.1.2

- Tested for Shadowlands beta 9.0.2.36086 x64
- Error fix for Shadowlands beta (9.x)
  -  I have no idea what's going on with that, but I just hacked out some code and it works now.
- Implemented a preference for the font to be used, so I can remove bold from numbers.
  -  This opens the way to have an options panel.
- Reduced the size of the font used in the hp/mp text on the character.
